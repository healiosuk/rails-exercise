# README

This exercise aims to help us understand your approach to building software with Rails.

## In scope

The goal is to enable you to demonstrate how you do the following:

- Write tests
- Write code
- Create components
- Name methods
- Structure commits
- Write commit messages
- Consider performance (if appropriate)

## Out of scope

- Making this a full end-to-end application with user logins, security etc. It's just to provide space for you to create models, views, controllers, components and specs to demonstrate the above
- Deploying to staging or production environments
- Setting up linters like Rubocop

## Brief

Please create a form for a clinician to write clinical notes in response to a series of questions. Each question should be mapped to one Autism DSM IV criterion.

In a separate view, for a given completed form, group the questions and their responses by DSM criteria to allow the clinician to read the notes they've taken for each criterion.
